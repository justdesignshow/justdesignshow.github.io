I wanted to rectify this by creating a more simplistic and eye-catching illustration for the front cover, using a two-tone colour palette (red and black), to symbolise the possibility of danger and death that is also associated with the thriller/horror bracket. My intention was to have the reader be able to tell what kind of book it is by just looking at it, and desire to know the mystery within.",
